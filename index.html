Wayvo Terms of Use and Data Policy
 
This document is for Facebook purposes only and is the exact same version users see when signing up for Wayvo.
 
Terms of Use
These Terms govern your use of Wayvo and the software we offer.
 
Your Commitments to Wayvo and Our Users
We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission of connecting people through conversation. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
 
When you use Wayvo you must:
·       Provide accurate information about yourself.
·       Create only one account (your own) and use the app for personal purposes.
·       Not share your password, give access to your Wayvo account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).
 
The Permissions you give us:
·  	Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance, and further develop it.
·  	If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take action against your account to protect our users and services, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it.
 
Limits on liability
·  	We work hard to provide the best app we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our app, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).
·      We cannot predict when issues might arise with our app. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
·  	We are not responsible for any charges or overages you may experience with your cellular network provider when contacts on Wayvo call your mobile number.
 
 Disputes
·      We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
·  	If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
 
 
 
 
 
Data Policy
This policy describes the information we process to support Wayvo, and features offered by Wayvo.
 
What kinds of information do we collect?
To provide our services and improve our platform, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our app.
 
·       Information and content you provide. The only personal information we collect about you is your name, Facebook profile picture, email, and phone number. Your name, Facebook profile picture, and email are collected when you click the “Continue with Facebook” button via our Facebook integration.
·       Contacts on the Wayvo App. We collect information about your contact list from the Wayvo app and how often you connect with them.
·       Your usage. We collect information about how you use our products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time and frequency of your activities. For example, we log when you have last used our app.
How do we use this information?
·       Personal Data We do not share or sell any of your personal data (name, profile picture, phone number, email, and usage data) with third parties or to show you ads. We only share this data with other Wayvo users when you allow us to - when you add them as a contact or accept their contact request.
·       Product research and development. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new features.
·   	Ads and other sponsored content. We do not sell your data to third parties or use your data to show you ads.
 
How can I manage or delete information about me?
We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Wayvo features, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs
 
 
How will we notify you of changes to this policy?
We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using Wayvo.
